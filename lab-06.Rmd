### Load packages and data

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse) 
library(dsbox)
library(mosaicData) 
```

### Exercise 1

```{r}
staff <- read_csv("data/instructional-staff.csv")
```

```{r}
staff_long <- staff %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -faculty_type, names_to = "year") %>%
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value))
```

```{r}
staff_long
```

```{r}
staff_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value, group = faculty_type, color = faculty_type)) +
  geom_line() + 
  labs(Title = "Faculty Type by Year", y = "Count", x = "Year", color = "Faculty Type")
```


> Include the line plot you made above in your report and make sure the figure width is large enough to make it legible.
Also fix the title, axis labels, and legend label.


### Exercise 2

> Suppose the objective of this plot was to show that the proportion of part-time faculty have gone up over time compared to other instructional staff types. What changes would you propose making to this plot to tell this story?  

- Can filter for part-time faculty then alter the plot so that the y-axis reflects change in percentage of faculty over time and the x-axis reflects year 

### Exercise 3

> Can you help them make improve it? First, brainstorm how you would improve it. Then create the improved visualization and document your changes/decisions with bullet points. It’s ok if some of your improvements are aspirational, i.e. you don’t know how to implement it, but you think it’s a good idea. Implement what you can and leave notes identifying the aspirational improvements that could not be made. (You don’t need to recreate their plots in order to improve them) 

Potential Improvements:  
- perhaps a bar graph would help to better visualize the smoothed line graph 
- adjusting the scale of the graph so that you can see the countries that have lower fishery production
- pie plots are not extremely informative, especially those with a hole in the middle (cannot see the angles which is how one determines sizes of categories)



```{r}
fisheries <- read_csv("data/fisheries.csv")
```

```{r}
fisheries
```


```{r}
fishlong <- fisheries %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(aquaculture,capture, total), 
               names_to = "Type",
               values_to = "Counts")
```

``` {r}
fishlong
```

```{r}
top20 <- fishlong %>% 
  arrange(desc(Counts)) %>%  
  top_n(20, Counts)
```

```{r}
top20 %>% 
  filter(Type != "total") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(country, -Counts), y = Counts, fill = Type)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +  
  labs(title = "Top Fish Producing Countries", subtitle = "By Production Type", x = "Country", y = "Counts") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) 

```


- this gives a graph of the top fish producing countries by production type 


## Stretch Practice with Smokers in Whickham

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(mosaicData)
```

```{r}
data("Whickham")
```

```{r}
?Whickham
library(performance)

```

### Exercise 1
> What type of study do you think these data come from: observational or experiment? Why?  

- Observational - since no variable is being manipulated 

### Exercise 2
> How many observations are in this dataset? What does each observation represent?  

- 1314 observations on women who wree classified as current smokers or have never smoked 

### Exercise 3
> How many variables are in this dataset? What type of variable is each? Display each variable using an appropriate visualization.  

3 variables - outcome (survival status after 20 years - levels alive/dead), smoker (baseline - levels yes/no), age (at time of first survey)

All variables are factors 

```{r}
Whickham %>%  
  count(outcome)
```
```{r}
Whickham %>%  
  count(smoker)
```

```{r}
summary(Whickham$age)
```

### Exercise 4
> What would you expect the relationship between smoking status and health outcome to be?  

- I would expect the relationship to be negative (positive smoking status and poor health outcome)


### Exercise 5
> Create a visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome. Briefly describe the relationship, and evaluate whether this meets your expectations. Additionally, calculate the relevant conditional probabilities to help your narrative. Here is some code to get you started:

```{r}
Whickham %>%
  count(smoker, outcome)
```
```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(~ smoker + outcome, data = Whickham)

```

```{r}
Whickham %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = smoker, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Grouped Bar Plot", x = "Smoker", y = "Count") 

```

- There appears to be a greater proportion of those who are smokers to be alive than dead, the opposite of what was anticipated

### Exercise 6

```{r}
Whickham_cat <- Whickham %>%  
  mutate(age_cat = case_when(
    age <= 44 ~ "18-44", 
    age > 44 & age <= 64 ~ "45-64",
    age > 64 ~ "65+"
    ))
```

### Exercise 7
> Re-create the visualization depicting the relationship between smoking status and health outcome, faceted by age_cat. What changed? What might explain this change? Extend the contingency table from earlier by breaking it down by age category and use it to help your narrative. We can use the contingency table to examine how the relationship between smoking status and health outcome differs between different age groups. This extension will help us better understand the patterns we see in the visualization, and explain any changes we observe. 

```{r}
Whickham_cat %>%
  count(smoker, age_cat, outcome) 
```

```{r}
library(vcd)
mosaic(~ smoker + outcome + age_cat, data = Whickham_cat)

```


```{r}
Whickham_cat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age_cat, fill = outcome)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~ smoker)
  labs(title = "Outcome by Age Category and Smoker Staus", x = "Age Category", y = "Count", fill = "Outcome") 

```
  
- there are greater number of alive and fewer dead in the youngest age group in the non-smokers  

- interestingly there is a greater number of alive in the smoker but also more dead in the middle age group   

- there are fewer alive in the oldest age group of smokers than non-smokers but more dead in the non-smokers than smokers   

- looking at the mosaic it looks like there is a greater proportion of dead non-smokers than there are smokers in all 3 age groups
